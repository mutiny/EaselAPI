# Prototype mod that aims to massively reduce lag associated with tilemaps and add full rgb chalk compatability over the network

# 

# Also aims to not break immersion with vanilla players by sending them the closest in game color to what you have picked.

# 

# Currently missing - rgb chalk lol, will add later

# Currently missing - when you leave a game without another person with this mod, when you rejoin the colors will all just be whatever the closest in game counterpart was. - could solved by making every rgba value an integer lol. will probably do that. - would break vanilla player immersion though.

# 

# \# Controls

# 

# While your chalk is out:

# Pressing Y will toggle dithering patterns!

# Holding alt will bring out the RGB color picker! You can click a color on the canvas to select it

# i am too lazy to add the rgb chalk support but i will later - cheers
